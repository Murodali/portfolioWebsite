                    <p className="pagragraph">I have bachelors' of 💻 Computer Science from 🎓University of Central Asia. I have a serious passion for 🔥 UI effects, animations, and creating intuitive, dynamic user experiences. Over the years I have managed to build a range of 🕸️ and 📱 applications.</p>
                    <p>Well-organized person🧍, problem solver🛠️, independent employee with high attention to detail⚠️. All projects are a problem to be solved, whether it’s to do with design or code—only the tools change. My process is iterative; I approach each problem as a learning experience that informs the rest of the project, which means that I tend to not rely on full design mockups. Most of the time, I do a few sketches📔 to flesh out a concept, and immediately dive into a working prototype that is much more flexible than jumping🦘 back and forth between code and Photoshop.</p>
                    <p>My formal art & design🎨 training taught me to carefully consider my audience and what experience I intend for them to have through my work👨‍💻. Who is visiting your site? What are they looking for? How do they find it? What analytics are available to base our decisions on?</p>
                    <p>With a strong emphasis on "Progressive Enhancement", I look for creative ways to push the boundaries of website front-end code without compromising on browser support and performance✨.</p>
